## Building from Source
This project also provides GitHub Actions to let you compile the software yourself easily. Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Download and install the latest version of [Bonjour SDK for Windows](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/).
3. Upload the `bonjoursdksetup.exe` to a cloud storage service and get the **direct URL** for the file.
4. Provide the direct URL to the GitHub Action, which will handle the rest.

# FREE AirPlay to your Windows PC
Free as both in "freedom" and "free beer"!

## Installation
1. Install the latest version of `Bonjour SDK for Windows` from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Bonjour%20SDK%20for%20Windows).
2. Download the latest version of uxplay-windows from [**releases**](https://github.com/leapbtw/uxplay-windows/releases/latest).

## FAQ
> [!NOTE]
> What is uxplay-windows?

[UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/) allows you to screen share from your Apple devices to non-Apple ones using AirPlay.

`uxplay-windows` (this project) provides binaries of UxPlay for Windows 10/11 users, making it easier for those who may find compiling UxPlay challenging.
Most other software achieving the same functionality as `uxplay-windows` is usually paid and non-free.

Just click on `More info` and it will let you install. It complains because the executable is not signed. If you don't trust this software you can always build it yourself! See below.  

> [!NOTE]
> UxPlay was updated, why isn't uxplay-windows?

~As of editing this (31 mar 2025) the upstream version sometime crashes and has a few issues. I'll try to update **uxplay-windows** once everything works correctly. Meanwhile you can always build the software yourself to get a more up-to-date version~

EDIT: (12 may 2025) I am now in the works of updating to the latest version
